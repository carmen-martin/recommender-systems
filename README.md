Final project for Optimization of Data Science course. Implementation of Frank-Wolfe algorithm and Franck-Wolfe with "in-face" directions.

# IDEAS:
* For the FW In-face algorithm, do a Grid Search with different values of 
        - $\delta$, 
        - $L_{bar} > L$, 
        - $\gamma_{1}$ and 
        - $\gamma_{2}$.
