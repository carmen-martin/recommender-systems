Implementation of Frank-Wolfe algorithm and Franck-Wolfe with "in-face" directions for matrix completition.

# Organization:
* In the 'matricesFW' file you can find the different functions needed for doing the matrix completition problem.
* An example of how to implement it is in the DatasetTesting notebook
* An implementation on a real world dataset can be found in the FW_GoodReads_recommender notebook
